# Jeremy

{: blame="Wix, Giraffe, Everyone in chat"}
> Jeremy is my favourite.

---
British twat, knows what monitors (speakers if you are dense) are, certified gorgeous lad, blonde. Ask me about Coffee. Often Jeremy is aleged to know a thing or two about audio and sound engineeting; as of yet little evidence has been found that can verify these claims.

Known for having Diabetes and Crohns disease, and sometimes **avoiding** (but never evading) taxes.

## Squallarms Plant

Jeremy likes to feel important, so we let him pretend he has a silly little engineering company.

Jeremy has never been - and will never be - a streamner.
